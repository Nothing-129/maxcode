/**
 * Persistence for the *availability* half of the update flow (is a newer
 * release out there?), kept separate from the backend-owned download/install
 * lifecycle in `update-provider.tsx`.
 *
 * Two facts survive a reload:
 *   * the last check and its result — so reloading a workspace window restores
 *     the badge instantly instead of re-fetching the manifest and going quiet
 *     for the first few seconds. Caching the *result*, not just the timestamp,
 *     is what keeps a throttled reload from claiming "you're up to date" when
 *     the previous check had in fact found something;
 *   * which version the user waved away — so the status-bar badge stops
 *     nagging for that release but comes back for the next one;
 *   * which release already produced the one-time discovery toast — so a
 *     cached offer restored in another window or after a relaunch does not
 *     announce itself again.
 *
 * Browser storage is isolated by backend origin. The existing local keys
 * stay unchanged so cached availability survives the desktop-shell cleanup.
 *
 * Every accessor is SSR- and private-mode-safe: a throwing/absent
 * `localStorage` degrades to "nothing remembered", never an exception.
