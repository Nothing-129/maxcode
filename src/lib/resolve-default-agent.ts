 * Priority (highest first):
 *   1. `lastSelected` — the user's most recent explicit selection in this
 *      draft's scope (per project folder; chat keeps its own memory).
 *   2. `folderDefault` — used only until the user has selected an agent.
 *   3. `inherit` — "new conversation" launched from inside an existing
 *      conversation should produce another conversation with the same agent.
 *   4. `sortedTypes[0]` — first entry of the user-managed drag-sorted list.
 *   5. `AGENT_DISPLAY_ORDER[0]` — final fallback when even the sorted list
 *      isn't available yet (cold start).
 *
 * The result is marked `provisional: true` for cases 3 and 4 when `fresh`
 * is false — i.e. the sorted list might still be stale or empty seed data
 * from localStorage, and the caller should re-resolve once fresh data
 * arrives.
