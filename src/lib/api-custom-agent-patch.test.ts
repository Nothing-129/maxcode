/**
 * `acp_save_custom_agent` is a FULL REPLACE: a declaration the payload leaves
 * out is cleared, not preserved. So a caller that changes one declaration has
 * to send every other one back — which makes the payload only as fresh as
 * whatever the caller holds.
 *
 * That matters because the custom-agent settings page renders several
 * independent cards over the SAME definition (skills, MCP), each loaded once on
 * mount. A card sending its own snapshot would revert whatever another card
 * saved after it mounted — turn MCP off, flip a skills switch, and codeg-mcp is
 * injected again, which is exactly the failure the MCP toggle exists to fix.
 *
 * `acpPatchCustomAgent` closes that by re-reading the definition immediately
 * before the write and applying only the caller's patch to it. These tests pin
 * both halves: the read-then-write ordering, and the field list (a declaration
 * added to `CustomAgentInfo` without being forwarded here is silently wiped).
