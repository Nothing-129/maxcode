 * Both conversation locations render this through `<ChatInput>` →
 * `<MessageInput>`:
 *   1. the new-conversation (welcome) input in the empty-state column
 *   2. the same input after the first send, docked at the bottom of the thread
 *
 * The box already looks ready to type. Do not add a click-only
 * `focus-within` ring — that is the style this module replaces.
